Summary
This is a proposal to create a center for theoretical research and training of advanced students and postdoctoral scientists at a location on North Cyprus. Funding for the center will come from international foundations and other private sources.

Stage one of the proposal calls for initial facilities to provide office space for up to 5 visiting faculty and postdoctoral associates.  Stage two plans are to add study space for an equal number of students.  Both stages should be completed, and the center fully operational, within five years.  Further expansion of the facilities are planned for later development, with the plan to double the size of the center by the end of ten years.

Objectives
The goal of the North Cyprus Black Hole Physics Center is to create a stimulating center in a tropical environment where scientists and their students can gather, think in depth, and exchange ideas about important scientific problems, especially in physics and related fields.  For students North Cyprus Black Hole Physics Center would provide an enhanced learning experience where they would complete their studies and begin to engage in active research programs.  For researchers, the seclusion of the center would provide ideal working conditions for theoretical investigations of fundamental problems as well as studies of important real-world issues expected to impact society in the future.

Funding
This is expected from various foundations and private sources, such as Kavli, Milner, or Simons.  Other international organizations are also envisioned as possible sources of support.


Institutions serving as role models
The Aspen Center for Physics, in Aspen, Colorado, USA, and the Centro de Estudios Científicos, in Valdivia, Chile, are two institutions with programs and size that BASIC draws on as role models.  It is sufficient here to quote from descriptions of the programs offered by these two institutions.

“The Aspen Center for Physics provides a stimulating, inspiring and beautiful surrounding for discussions, exchange of concrete research ideas, catching up on what others are working on, and gathering feedback on one's own research.”

"The Aspen Center for Physics is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all. The Center does not discriminate based on personal factors including (but not limited to) race, color, national or ethnic origin, alienage, age, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, political affiliation or philosophy, disability, or veteran's status. In its programs, on its campus, and among its participants and staff, the Center will not tolerate actions that constitute discrimination or harassment."

"The Center seems to have figured out an effective way to engage a group of us from different disciplines to interact naturally: put like-minded people in a beautiful and isolated place."

"The essence of the work at the Aspen Center for Physics lies in thought and communication. Set in a friendly, small town of inspiring landscapes, the Center is conducive to deep thinking with few distractions, rules or demands. In our "circle of serenity," physicists work at their own speeds and in their own ways: alone or together, at the desk, at the blackboard or in a chair on the lawn. Spontaneous discussions give rise to new collaborations.

The Center encourages individual and collaborative research and offers summer workshops and winter conferences in biophysics, astrophysics and cosmology, particle physics, and condensed matter physics. Cross-scientific workshops with other disciplines are scheduled when physics is central to the topic. Each year, over 1,000 scientists from around the world visit the Center to explore new research on the unanswered questions about our world and universe.

Physicists share their cutting-edge research with Aspen locals and visitors during the free Heinz R. Pagels and Maggie and Nick DeWolf lecture series. Informal physics dialogues and cafés give the audience additional opportunities to ask questions and engage in conversations. In the summer, the Center co-hosts a weekly picnic for children and their families with the Aspen Science Center. After the picnic, our physicists introduce big ideas to children of all ages.

"Our goal is simple: fine minds in an atmosphere of creative freedom."

Aspen brings together physicists from over 65 countries, and thanks to a Simons Foundation grant, it is seeking to expand its reach to developing countries. With ideas from different scientific disciplines, different cultures and varying perspectives, top physicists come to discuss, deny, develop, decipher, decode and determine new ideas, possibilities and advances in our scientific knowledge through interacting with fine minds in an atmosphere of creative freedom.
Centro de Estudios Científicos

FACULTY, POSTDOCS, AND STUDENTS
about 5-10 in residence at any given time, working in theoretical physics

http://www.cecs.cl/website/index.php/en/theoretical-physics-laboratory

other disciplines have comparable numbers, with another dozen or so undergraduate students in biology, and a few other undergraduates studying climate change

North Cyprus Black Hole Physics Center would have more in common the Centro de Estudios Científicos insofar as North Cyprus Black Hole Physics Center research would be expected to take place year round and not just as seasonal workshops as take place at the Aspen Center for Physics.
