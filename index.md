  Bumblebee is based on an insect whose ability to fly has sometimes been questioned on theoretical grounds, but which nonetheless is able to fly successfully.
  
  
 <p><b> Mission </b></p>

To catalyze, support, and disseminate research on questions at the foundations of physics and cosmology, particularly new frontiers and innovative ideas integral to a deep understanding of reality. 

 <p><b>Goals </b></p>

To expand the purview of scientific inquiry to include scientific disciplines fundamental to a deep understanding of reality of the nature.

To forge and maintain useful collaborations between researchers working on foundational questions in physics, cosmology, and related fields.

To provide the public with a deeper understanding of known and future discoveries in these areas, and their potential implications for our worldview.
